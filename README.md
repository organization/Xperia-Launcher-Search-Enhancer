# Xperia Launcher Search Enhancer

### What does this module do?

Fixes Xperia Launcher search by adding smart multilingual matching (Korean initial consonants, Japanese Hiragana/Katakana, Romaji, and Kanji pronunciation fallback), package-based English keyword matching, stale-result prevention, and safer search-result touch handling.

Tested on `Xperia 1 VII (71.1.A.2.119)`
